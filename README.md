#	Application of this knowledge
On venders’ side

•	Let vendor know people in which regions consumed more alcoholic beverages then vender can increase the supply for those regions. 

•	Let vendor know which regions brought less revenue and then the vender can increase the promotion and publicity to attract more users in those regions.

•	Let vendor know which kinds of alcoholic beverages can brought more revenue, then the vender can extend the production for those kinds of alcoholic beverages.

•	Let vendor know which alcoholic beverages gains more volume sold and then the vender can make a good market planning to get more profits.

•	Let vendor know people drink more in summer days, thus they can prepare for the huge consumption in advance.


On customers’ side

We can let customer know which alcoholic beverage is the most popular to help them to make a right choose.
What’s more we may predict the reason why people like or do not like a specific kind of alcoholic beverage by doing surveys which are combined with the knowledge we gained from this project.

For example, we can make online surveys in the county which gains less profit on a specific kind of alcoholic beverage. And ask people for what reasons they are not willing to consume this kind of alcoholic beverage, such as category, flavor, alcoholicity, taste flavor, liquid color, yeast, manufacture methods, etc. 

Other Application

After this, we can gain some other information by mining the online survey results, and find out why people do not like that kind of alcoholic beverage, and then we can send it to the beverage producers. Thus, they can make some improvement.

•	Use the Bayesian classification to predict the missing value (such as those alcoholic beverages which has no category label)

•	Use the Bayesian classification to classify the category attribute after 2017(like 2018)
